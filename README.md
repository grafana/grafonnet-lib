# Grafonnet

Jsonnet libraries for writing Grafana dashboards as code.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/grafana/grafonnet-lib.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/grafana/grafonnet-lib)

_**Attention:** We're in the process of introducing generated code that can be
used instead of the manually maintained Jsonnet code in the
[grafonnet](./grafonnet) directory. The generated code lives in
[grafonnet-7.0](./grafonnet-7.0). It's generated from a new project,
[grafana/dashboard-spec](https://github.com/grafana/dashboard-spec). The
generated code is still incomplete, however, the components present are useable.
We very much appreciate contributions in
[grafana/dashboard-spec](https://github.com/grafana/dashboard-spec) for
components yet to be added._
